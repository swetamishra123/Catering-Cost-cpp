# Catering Cost Calculator

This is a simple C++ program that calculates the cost of catering services for an event based on the number of guests and the duration of the event. It takes into account the cost of servers and food to provide an estimate to the customer.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/swetamishra123/Catering-Cost-cpp.git
   ```

2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

   ```sh
   g++ catering_cost.cpp -o catering_cost
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```sh
   ./catering_cost
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to input the event details, including the name of the event, customer name, number of guests, and event duration in minutes.

5. The program will calculate and display the estimated costs, the number of servers required, the cost for servers, the cost for food, the average cost per person, the total cost, and the 25% deposit needed to reserve the event.

```
Enter the name of the event
